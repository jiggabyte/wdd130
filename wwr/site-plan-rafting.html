    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is the general public, but mostly adventurers and rafters both the experienced and enthusiasts, most people find it difficult to find a good location to go rafting as an individual or with family and so sometimes are the mercy of wild river or rafting companies who provide no support in terms of security and rescue in case of mishaps and are not enlightened about our services. They are in need of enlightenment and also have the right to go rafting with all the serenity and security / support we provide. They spend money on companies who do not provide them good value for their money and so we are providing them an alternative solution to give good value for their money. They will access my website through the browser on the internet on desktop and mobile phones.</p>
